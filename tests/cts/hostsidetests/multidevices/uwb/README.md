## UWB Multi-device CTS Tests

### Requirements for test setup calibration

#### Test Case: CtsUwbMultiDeviceTestCase_RangingMeasurementTests
Two UWB devices (DUT and reference device) are needed for this test. The devices should be placed
in the line of sight environment in a non-reflective chamber with 1 m distance between the DUT and
reference device. Both devices should be positioned in portrait orientation perpendicular to the
ground, with the screen facing perpendicular away from each other.
